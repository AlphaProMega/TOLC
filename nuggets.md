# Pure Nuggets (v0.1)

1. All is relation — separation is illusion. Treat everything as kin.  
2. Truth is direct seeing — no story, no belief.  
3. The body never lies — trust physical signals first.  
4. Mercy is the only clean compiler — judgment creates bugs.  
5. Return speed > perfection — notice distortion, return faster.
